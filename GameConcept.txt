Every Seeker and the hider get a coin every minute. Everyone starts with 50 coins.
The hider has to answer each question from seekers correctly.


The hider can cast one spell (each lasting 5 minutes) per minute at maximum:
	- Freeze Seeker (-15 coins): Seeker cannot ask questions until he's defrosted and everything he does is slowed down in update for other seekers to once per minute
	- Freeze Area (-25 coins): Seekers can easily catch a cold in this area and can only look at the positions of other seekers once per minute. Also any updates (questions) are slowed down to once per minute
	- Smoke Bomb (-30 coins): Any position in the smoke bomb area is not shown on the map for seekers
	- Skip Question (-35 coins): The hiders answer can be different from the truth for a single question


- Show own position on a random large circle for a brief moment to all seekers (+100 coins)
- Seekers fortune (+5 coins): Any seeker in this area gets twice as many coins per minute
